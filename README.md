S3 Listing & Zip Downloader
===========================

This application provides a list view for you s3 bucket using the [s3 Bucket Listing Library](https://github.com/rgrp/s3-bucket-listing).  It also provides the ability to download a zipped folder of all assets that you are currently looking at.  This library uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for a nice look and feel.

Running the App
---------------

Once you have cloned the repository, you will need to install the required javascript libraries.  We use [Bower](http://bower.io/) to manage these libraries.  Once you installed Bower, you can run the following command:

```
bower install .
```

You should also open the `index.html` file, and set the S3 configurations for your bucket.
